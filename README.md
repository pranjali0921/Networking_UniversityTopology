# Networking: University Network Topology with Wireless Implementation

## Overview

In this networking project, we designed a robust and efficient network topology for a university environment using the renowned software, Cisco Packet Tracer. The primary goal was to create a comprehensive network infrastructure that caters to the diverse needs of a modern university while incorporating wireless networking systems to enhance connectivity and mobility.
In this project, we have defined a simulation of campus networks based on wireless networking. The network is divided into two sets: one for the campus area and the other for the hostel area consisting of a boy's and girl's block.
The campus area is divided into three parts:
1. Server Center
2. Academic Block
3. Dome Building
   
The academic block is further dived into two parts, AB1 and AB2. While the Dome Building hosts the library and the IT department.
The major aim of this project is to show the wireless connectivity that is used in universities to make the network efficient and mobile at the same time. Mobility is the major concentration of this project. In order to provide equal functionality to all the users (college staff and students), we have added DNS, Email, and HTTP servers for the maximum utilization of resources. Along with the servers, the university network consists of:
1. Routers
2. Switches
3. PC’s
4. Laptops
5. Smartphones

To design the wireless network of the university we initially started by placing the core devices into the frame as mentioned in the layout.

● Firstly, we placed the main router at the center of the university outline, which was further connected to the server switch using the gigabit ethernet port with copper straight-through cable and sub routers (campus router and hostel router) using the serial port with serial DCE cable at the hostel area and campus area respectively.

● The server switch was further connected to the EMAIL, DNS, and WEB servers respectively.

● Campus router was connected to the campus switch which was further connected with wireless access points of the academic block (AB1 and AB2), dome building, library, and IT department.

● The wireless access points were then connected to computing devices (PCs, laptops, and smartphones).

● Similarly, the hostel router was connected to the hostel switch which was further connected to the wireless access point of the boy's block and the girl's block.

● The wireless access points were then connected to the computing devices (PCs, laptops, and smartphones), every area has a dedicated access point which can only be connected with the help of a password.

● All these connections are made through ethernet ports (gigabit ethernet and fast ethernet) using copper straight-through cables.
